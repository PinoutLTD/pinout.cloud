            <p class="text-normal">Management companies are responsible for maintaining buildings in a safe and comfortable condition. Full automation of all processes is not yet possible, but today digitalization and IoT solutions can significantly simplify many tasks. For example, smart water and electricity meters allow you to analyze resource consumption and optimize costs. Sensors in engineering systems record deviations from the norm and automatically create requests for diagnostics or repairs, helping to quickly respond to problems.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">
              In many countries, management companies have difficulty providing a full range of services, and those who successfully cope with this task are actively introducing digital technologies into the daily processes of their employees.

              Pinout offers one of the newest tools on the market of digital solutions for management companies, and will help establish a direct dialogue between devices and your employees, literally.

            <h3 class="text">CMMS – a digital assistant in building management</h3>
            <p class="text-normal">For effective management of facility maintenance, CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) are used – specialized systems that allow you to plan work, assign responsible persons, keep records of completed tasks and generate reports.</p>
            <p class="text-normal">
              Modern CMMS often overlap with ERP and CRM systems, blurring the boundaries between them. However, their key task is to manage physical objects and analyze data from IoT devices. CMMS can be either a standalone solution or an integrated part of a large CRM/ERP platform. Most of these systems are closed solutions that require significant licensing and support costs. In this context, it is worth noting Odoo, which, thanks to its open architecture, can be deployed on the company's own servers, providing autonomy and full control over data.

            <h3 class="text">Digital Twin of a Building: Transparency Without Cloud Reliance</h3>
            <p class="text-normal"> A digital twin is a virtual copy of a building that displays its current state in real time. It receives data from IoT devices, records the history of maintenance and repairs, providing full control and transparency of facility management.</p>
